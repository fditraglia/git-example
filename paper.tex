\section{Introduction}
You may have been told that the central limit theorem is the crowning glory of probability theory.
Whoever said that was exaggerating.
As we hope to convince you, the central limit theorem is false.
If you think we're crazy, it's \emph{you} who are crazy!

The outline of this paper is as follows.
First we will ramble for a while about hundreds of irrelevant references.
Then we will introduce more notation than you can possibly remember.
Then we will prove our main result at an absurd level of generality.
Then we will show you the results of a very contrived simulation exercise in which our proposed method works better than every other method anyone has ever thought of.
Then we will conclude the paper with a short conclusion listing our main conclusions.
